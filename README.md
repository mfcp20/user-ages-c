# User Ages Program in C



This is a simple C program that demonstrates the use of **structs** and **functions** in C.  

The program allows multiple users to register their **names** and **ages**, then calculates and displays:



\- The sum of all ages  

\- The average age  

\- A list of all registered users  



---



## Features



\- Uses a `struct` to store each user's name and age  

\- Collects input using functions for names (`nameUser`) and ages (`ageUser`)  

\- Calculates sum and average of ages using separate functions (`sumAge` and `aveAge`)  

\- Displays all users clearly and prints a friendly goodbye message
